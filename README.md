# Invoice-generator


The primary purpose of an invoice generator is to provide a business and its client with a record 
of sale. An invoice serves an important purpose in small business accounting: invoices 
demonstrate a clientâ€™s obligation to pay you for your services. An invoice offers verification, in 
writing, of the payment agreement between your business and its client. Invoices set your 
payment terms and enable you to get paid faster for your services.
